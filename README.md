# DatabaseKookies

This system is available as a webpage.

## Materials and Recepies

Materials can be handled under the navbar element named 'Ingredients'
This presents a view where all ingredents are listed and a field for each ingredient where new deliveries of that ingredient can be registered.

Recipies are handled under the navbar element 'Products' 
The products view presents a list of all currently available products as well as functionality to create or edit existing products.

## Production, Blocking, Pallets

There are links to the views for Production blocks and Pallets in the navbar.

In the production block view, the production blocks are listed, and new production blocks can be created. In the list, a production block can also be clicked and the user can then view a list of all affected pallets by that production block.

The pallet view by default produces a list of all pallets. The user can then use the search tools visible on the page to filter the pallets by product, date produced and if the pallet is blocked.
New pallets can also be produced by clicking the button "Produce Pallet" on this page.

## Misc

Functionality for listing and creating orders are available under "Orders" in the navbar.
The same is also true for managing Customers.
